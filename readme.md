# React Marquee Text

MarqueeText is a React component that takes it back to the internet of days gone by. Paying homage to the vintage (and beloved) Marquee element, MarqueeText inserts areas of continuous scrolling text, empowering your retro or brutalist-inspired designs.

**Demo Run**: `npm run demo:start` <br/>
**Demo Build**: `npm run demo:build` <br/>
**Demo Clean**: `npm run demo:clean` <br/>

### Dev

Runing `dev` fires up the docs/demo and begins watching `src`.

The docs/demo app is bundled with [`Parcel.js`](https://parceljs.org/) and served at [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

### Dist

On build, `src` populates `dist` with commonjs, es, umd versions of the component.

## 🕹️ Usage

###

```
<MarqueeText
  duration={30}
  pauseOnHover={true}
  direction="right"
>
  This be some right scroll text
</MarqueeText>
```

## 📓 Notes

### Mostly inlined CSS

The package largely uses inlined CSS. Currently, the `@keyframes` animation is the only declaration housed in an external CSS file. `styles.css` is imported into the `tsx` file, but given your bundle setup, you may, or may not, have to handle that import. If the animation doesn't run immediately, try importing `react-marquee-text/styles.css` directly in your project.

### Supports HTML tags

MarqueeText supports HTML elements, so you can wrap your text in spans or divs to style specific words.

<br/>

## 📅 To Dos

- Add option to control animation based on scroll position.
- Maybe add some callbacks?
- Maybe add vertical scrolling option?
- Run more robust perf tests. Would js / RAF animation or WAAPI be better, esp for multiple instances?
- Add some proper tests

<br/>

## 📅 Changelog

### 1.0.5

Have fun ya'll.
